                <h2>Volopay</h2>
                <p>I started my career as a Backend Developer Intern at Volopay which is a fintech start-up that developed and maintains an expense management software used by many businesses. As a backend developer, my work experience was both challenging and rewarding. As a backend developer I developed and maintained the server-side components of an application, which includes designing and implementing the application's logic, data models, and APIs. I worked closely with other members of the development team, such as frontend developers, designers, and product managers, to ensure that the application met the requirements of stakeholders.</p>
                <p>One of my primary responsibilities was to design and develop the application's data models. This involved working with databases, namely PostgreSQL, to create and manage the application's data structures. I still have a solid understanding of the database design and management, as well as experience in using database management systems.</p>
                <p>Another important responsibility I had was to develop the application's APIs. This involved designing the endpoints and creating the necessary code to handle data requests and responses. I gained experience in programming languages such as Python, Ruby, as well as experience in using API frameworks like Flask, Django and Ruby on Rails.</p>
                <p>In addition to these technical responsibilities, I was also an effective problem solver. I could debug and troubleshoot issues that arise in the application, and work collaboratively with other members of the development team to resolve them. I also wrote clean and efficient code that could scale to meet the demands of a growing user base.</p>
                <h2>Deloitte USI</h2>
                <p>As a Cloud Data Engineer at Deloitte USI, I’ve found myself right at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and real-world problem solving. Every day brings a new challenge, and I genuinely enjoy rolling up my sleeves to tackle them—whether it’s wrangling data, designing cloud architectures, or collaborating with brilliant teammates.</p>
                <p>My main playground is the cloud, where I use Python, SQL, and data warehousing tools to build data solutions that are not just robust, but also scalable and future-ready. Thanks to the mentorship and collaborative spirit at Deloitte, I’ve become well-versed in AWS and have delivered cloud-based solutions that make data management and analytics both efficient and flexible.</p>
                <p>I’ve also had the chance to work with a variety of platforms—Snowflake, Oracle Analytics Cloud, and Power BI, to name a few. This diversity keeps things interesting and ensures I’m always learning something new, whether it’s optimizing a tricky query or designing a data model that makes complex information accessible and actionable.</p>
                <p>Working with Oracle Fusion Cloud has further expanded my toolkit, giving me the adaptability to jump between technologies based on each project’s needs. And, of course, none of this would be as rewarding without the collaborative environment at Deloitte USI, where I get to team up with talented professionals and contribute to projects that truly make a difference for our clients.</p>
                <p>In short, my time at Deloitte USI has been a journey of continuous growth and discovery. I’m passionate about staying ahead in the ever-evolving world of AI and data engineering, and I’m excited to keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible—one data solution at a time.</p>
