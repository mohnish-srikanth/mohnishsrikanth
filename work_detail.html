                <h2>My Work Experience</h2>
                <p>I started my career as a Backend Developer Intern at Volopay which is a fintech start-up that developed and maintains an expense management software used by many businesses. As a backend developer, my work experience was both challenging and rewarding. As a backend developer I am developing and maintaining the server-side components of an application, which includes designing and implementing the application's logic, data models, and APIs. I am working closely with other members of the development team, such as frontend developers, designers, and product managers, to ensure that the application meets the requirements of stakeholders.</p>
                <p>One of my primary responsibilities is to design and develop the application's data models. This involves working with databases, namely PostgreSQL, to create and manage the application's data structures. I have a solid understanding of the database design and management, as well as experience in using database management systems.</p>
                <p>Another important responsibility I have is to develop the application's APIs. This involves designing the endpoints and creating the necessary code to handle data requests and responses. I have experience in programming languages such as Python, Ruby, as well as experience in using API frameworks like Flask, Django and Ruby on Rails.</p>
                <p>In addition to these technical responsibilities, I am also an effective problem solver. I can debug and troubleshoot issues that arise in the application, and work collaboratively with other members of the development team to resolve them. I also write clean and efficient code that can scale to meet the demands of a growing user base.</p>
