                <h2>Volopay</h2>
                <p>I started my career as a Backend Developer Intern at Volopay which is a fintech start-up that developed and maintains an expense management software used by many businesses. As a backend developer, my work experience was both challenging and rewarding. As a backend developer I developed and maintained the server-side components of an application, which includes designing and implementing the application's logic, data models, and APIs. I worked closely with other members of the development team, such as frontend developers, designers, and product managers, to ensure that the application met the requirements of stakeholders.</p>
                <p>One of my primary responsibilities was to design and develop the application's data models. This involved working with databases, namely PostgreSQL, to create and manage the application's data structures. I still have a solid understanding of the database design and management, as well as experience in using database management systems.</p>
                <p>Another important responsibility I had was to develop the application's APIs. This involved designing the endpoints and creating the necessary code to handle data requests and responses. I gained experience in programming languages such as Python, Ruby, as well as experience in using API frameworks like Flask, Django and Ruby on Rails.</p>
                <p>In addition to these technical responsibilities, I was also an effective problem solver. I could debug and troubleshoot issues that arise in the application, and work collaboratively with other members of the development team to resolve them. I also wrote clean and efficient code that could scale to meet the demands of a growing user base.</p>
